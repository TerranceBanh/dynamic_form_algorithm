Code was compressed into for loops
In ./includes/new_data/new_data_algorithm removed:
  echo $input . '.css("display", "none");';
  echo $subcategory . 'Title.css("display", "none");';
  These lines are not needed due to them inheriting the same display values as parent
Nested navigation buttons in form
Fixed glitch where relative file could not be included due to misunderstanding that relative file works from the current working document and not the file being edited.
