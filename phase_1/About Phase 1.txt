In this phase the code shall be coded in the most the simple manner. Avoiding Loops, Functions. Creating a more visual format of what the code is doing.

This project has the following purposes:
  To create a dynamic form template that makes it easy to create multiple forms.
  To create a theory to systematically create code in a organized and controlled manner avoiding human error.
  To create a references that can act as fallbacks if the next iteration of recoding fails

If loops are planned to be used hand code each iterations instead
If functions are planned to be used only use them for long and repetitive code
Use recursive functions if each nested loop is the same executed code
